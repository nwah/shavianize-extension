# Shavianize Chrome Extension
Automatically transliterate webpages from standard English orthography to the [Shavian alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavian_alphabet).

Under the hood, it uses my [to-shavian](https://github.com/nwah/to-shavian) library to do the transliteration.

This is a work in progress.
